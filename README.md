# Multi Media Systems

This repository contains the full collection of assignments for the course:\
**CE363 - Multimedia Systems.**

## Assignments

I have created a directory for each assignment. Each directory contains one assignment and 
one file called `README.md` which contains the assignment description.
We have had three assignments for this course. which are:
### Assignment 1: [Assignment 1](https://github.com/FarshidNooshi/Multi-Media-Systems/tree/master/assignment%201) 
    
this assignment was to create a simple multimedia content. I have created a simple video of creation of 
a tensor with small cubes with different colors using the manim library. a brief description of the assignment
is available in the `README.md` file of the assignment.

### Assignment 2: [Assignment 2](https://github.com/FarshidNooshi/Multi-Media-Systems/tree/master/assignment%202)

this assignment was to create Image histogram systematization system. I have prepared a simple image 
histogram systematization system with the help of the `matplotlib`, `numpy` and `Pillow` libraries and all of the
algorithms are implemented from scratch. A brief description of the assignment is available in the `README.md` file of the assignment.
### Assignment 3: [Assignment 3](https://github.com/FarshidNooshi/Multi-Media-Systems/tree/master/assignment%203)
    
this assignment was to create JPEG compression system. I have prepared a simple JPEG compression system with the
help of the different libraries. algorithms of the JPEG compression system are implemented from scratch.
The Compression is done with **the YCrCb, Chroma Subsampling, Quantization, RLC and Huffman algorithms.**\
A brief description of the assignment is available in the `README.md` file of the assignment.

### Final Project: [Final Project](https://github.com/CEIT-AUT/hollyworld)
    
This Project was for building an IMDB website clone using **Docker, Dash Protocol for streaming online and chunking data, Angular Framework for Frontend, SQLite for Database and GoLang for Backend**

for Chunking Data and streaming online we used Dash Protocol and Python FFmpeg Video Streaming Library.
#### Approaches for online streaming
* plain VoD for streaming videos 
* implementation of our own backend server for Dash protocol and streaming
* using HLS protocol and VoD for streaming
